## Standardized protocol to calculate leaf area

This is an addition to the PFTC teaching material: <https://plant-functional-trait-course.github.io/PFTC_teaching_material/5_trait_collection.html>

#### 1. Scan the leaf

Clean the scanner surface to avoid debris in the scan and place the leaf upside down on the scanner.

Scanner settings:

-   *Type: JPEG*

-   *Color*

-   *Full color range*

-   *300dpi*

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```
